# sarf
Sarf - Arabic Morphology System

I found the source code posted on sourceforge here https://sourceforge.net/projects/sarf/files/sarf/sarf%201.0/. The code is also hosted by others.
Here is an example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxscout/sarf.

My goal is to keep the code up to date and keep up with newer libraries and framework.

All source code files *.java and *.xml are converted to UTF-8. 
I relaxed the screen resolution requirement and will remove that in the future hopefully.
